# GoWatch
non-interactive timer for use while exercising


I like to go running, often for a predetermined time or distance. I usually just start at my front door and run through the neighborhood. 

This leads to problems, especially when an hour run ends and I'm an hour's run away from my front door.

In the spirit of "build the tool you need", GoWatch was conceived as a minimally-invasive way to let me know when my planned run is half over, and to start considering turning back toward home.

As is, it's just a timer that beeps once at an interval set by the user, alerting the user but not requiring any sort of interaction. 

Planned features:

Pulldown notification with time remaining until next alert

Ability to set the number of times an alert repeats (as of now, alerts repeat infinitely until stopped manually)

STREEEEEEEEETCH GPS integration to allow alerts by distance instead of (or in addition to) time.
